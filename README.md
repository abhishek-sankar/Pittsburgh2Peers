## 🚀 **Overview**

Pittsburgh2Peers was initially launched to assist students arriving in Pittsburgh. It quickly grew into a tool for:

- **Airport Ride Sharing**: Find people arriving at the same time to split costs and travel safely.
- **U-Haul Sharing**: Coordinate with peers for bulk moves and save on expenses.
- **Making Connections**: Start your Pittsburgh journey with new friends.

With over **1,000 unique visits**, **350 Andrew sign-ins**, and **150 completed requests** in 2 weeks, Pittsburgh2Peers seems to be an app worth pursuing.

## 🧑‍💻 **Development Story**

We built Pittsburgh2Peers because we noticed gaps in how students connect and coordinate when they first arrive. Inspired by the desire to make a positive impact, we collaborated intensively for a week to develop this app.

### Key Moments:
- Resolved early bugs affecting date matching within hours of feedback.
- Extended functionality to include U-Haul sharing after identifying a common student need.
- Prioritized accessibility and user-centric design for a better experience.

## 🌟 **Next Steps**

Although the app was tailored for move-in season, we're exploring how to expand its utility throughout the year. Potential ideas include:
- **Event Coordination**: Helping students find buddies for events or study groups.
- **Local Community Engagement**: Connecting CMU/UPitt students with city resources.
